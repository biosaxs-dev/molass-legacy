# AI Assistant Initialization Guide — molass-legacy

**Purpose**: Initialize AI context for navigating this repository  
**Created**: February 19, 2026

> **Note**: This is a legacy codebase. Active development happens in `molass-library`.  
> This repo is a **runtime dependency** of `molass-library` (see `pyproject.toml` there).  
> For the main AI context file, see `molass-library/.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

## What This Repo Is

Molass Legacy is the original GUI-based MOLASS tool, refactored into a library that `molass-library` imports at runtime. It contains ~80 sub-packages covering the full SEC-SAXS analysis pipeline from data loading to 3D reconstruction.

**Key relationship**: `molass-library/molass/Rigorous/` and `molass-library/molass/LowRank/` call into this repo. The two repos must be sibling directories for tests to work (see `pythonpath` in `molass-library/pyproject.toml`).

## Key Algorithm: `recognize_peaks` (QuickAnalysis/ModeledPeaks.py)

This function is the **default peak initializer** for `molass-library`'s decomposition and the root cause of the P1+ overlap failure diagnosed on Feb 19, 2026.

### Algorithm (greedy sequential subtraction)

```
recognize_peaks(x, y, num_peaks, exact_num_peaks):
    y_copy = y.copy()
    for k in range(max_num_peaks):
        params = get_a_peak(x, y_copy)   # fit tallest peak via argmax + Gaussian width scan
        y_model = EGH(x, params)
        y_copy -= y_model                # subtract fitted peak from residual
        peaks_list.append(params)
    return peaks_list
```

### Known failure mode

At high component overlap (≥19% shared area), the tallest-peak fit absorbs signal from both components. After subtraction, the residual is distorted. The second peak's initialization is therefore unreliable. Combined with a single Nelder-Mead run downstream (no multi-start), this produces high variance in decomposition quality.

### Workaround

The `proportions` path in `molass-library` bypasses `recognize_peaks` entirely, using cumulative-area slicing instead. See `molass-library/molass/Decompose/Proportional.py`.
